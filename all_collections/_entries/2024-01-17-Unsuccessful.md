Despite retries, I have been unsuccessful. It's disappointing. I couldn't maintain the journal regularly, didn't code anywhere close to what I wanted, settled into a bad sleep routine (at least it's a routine), and had low productivity overall. Cooked less, exercised less and didn't go out much, but didn't get a lot done. If something, I have only realized that web3 and cryptography rabbit hole is bigger than what I thought it was last week.

Sometimes it's necessary to remind myself what I have been thrown into and what I have signed up for. Life is different for everyone, with everyone having some struggles at some point or the other. For me at the moment, it's the realization of my incompetence in my field of interest, dissatisfaction at the rate I'm improving, and lastly, unemployment (sometimes I think I'll think of this as a blessing in disguise in the future, but in the moment, it does hurt a bit {is it peer-pressure?}.) I have experienced minor set-backs in the past (which I think pivotted my life in the right direction) which makes handling this one easier. I also have worked really hard to gain knowledge in the past (which is what I'm unable to repeat), which gives me some confidence to pull it off again.

What do I need to do going ahead? Act according to a schedule? Rage against laziness and distractions? Take reserved time off for leisure?.. To be continued some other time...
