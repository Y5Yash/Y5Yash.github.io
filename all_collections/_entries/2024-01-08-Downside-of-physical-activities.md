We all have heard how important excercising is for our physical and mental health. I can't agree more. So why do a lot of people not do it? One reason is of course motivation. It takes effort and will power to go out and put in the efforts to get fitter. But that's only when you don't love your work-out. I happen to love sports and it should not be a concern for me. Another reason could be the threshold fitness required to get fitter. You can't practice for a marathon on a wheel chair. This also means that you need to act before it's too late in life. There's one more reason why a lot of people don't excercise: time.

It takes certain minutes/hours of your day if you excercise. You could be working two shifts or just be poor with time-management (I can relate) to not be able to find time for what's important. But that's not it. What a lot of us are aware of but rarely talk about is the short-term effect of excercise - tiredness. One hour of running doesn't take just one hour from the rest of your day. You need to sleep more (sometimes doze-off when you shouldn't), and are tired to do other physically demanding activities. Your productivity for the entire day might take a huge hit. This is especially true on days you exert yourself more than usual. The key could be to do a healthy amount of excercise everyday and fit yourself in a balanced schedule. While that's a good enough strategy, pushing yourself further can have their own benefits. You discover your new limits, you might learn new skill, and gain confidence. If you want to learn something everytime you excercise, you need to push yourself. That brings us back to, ..., low productivity during the day.
