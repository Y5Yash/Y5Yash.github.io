Had an awesome start to the day - Full court basketball matches. Didn't perform really well, but let's leave it for the moment. The day was again not productive; I hardly put in the hours I need to. Cooked idly for 2.5 hours (it was good!:yum: but not worth the time spent).

I definitely need to listen to my last entry and take the call. *Stick to the plan*. I think I have a lot of pending stuff. Tomorrow I start with the most important tasks first.

Once again, Merry X-mas :christmas_tree:
