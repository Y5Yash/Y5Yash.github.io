*Spotlight Effect*: You believe that people think about you more than they actually do. You don't need to impress others, solely because that doesn't mean anything more than a momentary thought for them. I think it's a bad blanket statement, of course some acts of service might leave a lifetime impression, but don't try to impress in ways that don't matter. Make a fool of yourself if it is more fun. Cringe people are happier than serious people, more often than not. But do balance it considering the fact that you'll facepalm yourself (if not outright regret) thinking of the stupid stuff you do today 10 years down the line.
