I've thought of starting and maintaining a blog many times in the past half decade, but chose to be a victim of circumstances. It took me joblessness to finally put in the efforts required to start blogging and journaling. Of course, this is the first journal entry and I don't know how this will turn out :crossed_fingers:.

To understand how resource intensive and enjoyable blogging and journaling are, I plan to journal for 30 days, starting from 17th December 2023 to 15th January 2024. I also take up other daily challenges to make these 30 days more interesting: 1) No Insta/FB/etc. 2) Cook at least one meal 3) Code at least 100 lines of code and 3) Some physical activity. I also want to use Twitter more, maintain good sleep hygiene and finish reading one paper a day. I will also pen down (type out) some philosophical thoughts in the journal. I don't plan to make sense in this journal, and will steer as it fits convenient. Whenever my older self deems this to be cringe above a threshold, he will delete this.

In contrast, I intend to write **serious** blogs. They can either be note-taking, intuition-registration, hacks which I'll otherwise forget, or just explanations of things I found interesting. While I don't intend to maintain professional standards in my blog posts, I'll be happy to be corrected and scrutinized over small details.

It's already 18th and I've missed my sleeping goals already. It's time I sign-out for the day. I will continue rambling my half-cooked thoughts tomorrow. Best of luck to myself :thumbsup:.
