# :fireworks: :confetti_ball: Happy New Year :confetti_ball: :fireworks:

Let's take a moment to appreciate ***zenosyne***, the feeling that time goes by faster as we age. This year ended sooner than last year. That's true every year. Quite a few things happened to me this year; new experiences, continuous hustle (for the employer), interesting trips with friends and an international trip. This year should have felt slower than the past years. But it doesn't. In addition, I can't recall what happened in the previous two years without thinking hard.

What does it imply? I'd guess that it means that every year in the future will follow the same trend, regardless how hard I try. I am yet to experience a lot of *stuff* that most humans get to feel. Is it good or bad? I'll look at the bright side; I am young in terms of experiences. In terms of perception, I'm past the half-life mark already.

*Zenosyne* also implies that I value a day lesser that earlier. That's something to beware of. I think it's easier to waste a day and not feel guilty enough about it. I need to think harder on this in my solitude.

With drowsy eyes, I'll bid farewell to 2023 and writing this entry. I'll continue typing thoughts later. I just had to hit some keys for 1st day of 2024.(*Hopefully) Happy New Year!!
