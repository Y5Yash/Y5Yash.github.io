- [x] Write a Journal entry
- [ ] Maintain a good sleep hygiene (sleep between 11 pm to 12 am)
- [x] No Insta/FB/etc. Limited time (if any) on Twitter
- [ ] Code at least 100 lines of code
- [x] Research a topic/Apply to 3+ jobs for the day

Let's finish it tomorrow. All the applications on the whiteboard. It's really tough and is getting dragged unnecessarily. Coding begins strictly after that.

Watched a few videos on US finances, and if they apply to India, then don't bet on comfortable future. We will probably work till retirement. Will we own a house? Hopefully! (average salaries won't be able to finance it).
