Here's the confession again, I'm failing. While I have the motivation, I don't have the discipline to persist. Sitting to work at 4:30 pm is definitely not productive. What am I doing wrong? I have given up the more addictive social media, not watching movies and TV series, and neither do I spend time with friends much. I know running and basketball is tiring and I need to sleep more. Not having done much during the day, I push myself at night while having low productivity. Sleep hygiene has gone for a toss.

Let's start by restricting time on youtube and twitter (put a timer). Train twitter algo to only show relevant content. Cut distractions. Sleep by 12 am daily. Spend less time on cooking (review the rule on 31st). Clear backlog of work. It's difficult, but it's the only way forward.
