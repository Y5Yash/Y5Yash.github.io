This realization has just hit me. When you make a plan, it's very important to keep in mind that uncertain events will occur and potentially derail you. It's upto you when these events occur to decide what matters the most; you can either stick to the plan and not care about the uncertain event (which might be uncharacteristic of you) or you react naturally to the uncertain event, ignoring the plan temporarily. Personally, it's hard for me to break character and stick to the plan. I think that's limiting me.

I think the best way to go forward would be to document what went wrong and do the best thing possible to avoid it further. Also, consider changing the character later. Inspiration - that friend who puts study/work above every thing else.
