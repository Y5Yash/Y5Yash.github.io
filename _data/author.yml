    Hey! I am Yash, a B.Tech in C.S. + M.S. by research in Computational Natural Sciences student at IIIT Hyderabad.
    <br/>
    I recently defended my Master's thesis in Computational High Energy Physics.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I love physics, mathematics and computer science. I have a <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9680581' target='_blank'>publication</a> (and a patent) in proof-of-useful-work protocols.
    I am on a quest to learn more on applications of cryptography like ZKPs, MPC, FHE, VRFs, RLNs, E2E verifiable voting, etc.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I engage in a lot of group discussions and am open to hear and brainstorm on anything interesting. Currently, I am looking for a job that would best suit my interests and skills.
