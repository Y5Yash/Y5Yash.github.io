    I am a B.Tech in Computer Science + M.S. by research in Computational Natural Sciences student at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad.
    <br/>
    I am doing my Master's in Computational High Energy Physics.

  <br/>
  <p>
    I love physics, mathematics and computer science. I have a <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9680581' target='_blank'>publication</a> (and a provisional patent) in proof-of-useful-work protocols.
    Currently, I am exploring cryptography and its applications like zkSNARKs, end-to-end auditable voting, multiparty computation, fully homomorphic encryption, etc.

    I engage in a lot of group discussions and would be open to hear anything interesting. I am actively looking for job opportunites at the moment.
